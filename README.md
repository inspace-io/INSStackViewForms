# Introduction

**INSStackViewForms** was written by **[Micha≈Ç Zaborowski](https://github.com/m1entus)** for **[inspace.io](http://inspace.io)**

# INSStackViewForms

`INSStackViewForms` is a library for creating dynamic UIStackView forms. It subclass from UIStackView. Fully compatible with Swift & Obj-C. The goal of the library is to make modular forms created from already defined custom views. Main advantage of this library is that we build it using UIStackView which don't dequeue views, so you have access to all views all the time.

INSStackViewForms provides a very powerful DSL (Domain Specific Language) used to create a form. It keeps track of this specification on runtime, updating the UI on the fly.

If you want to support <iOS9 where UIStackView is not available, solution is to use [OAStackView](https://github.com/oarrabi/OAStackView). All you need to do is import `OAStackView` to your project and all magic will be done.

# Usage
```objective-c
[self.stackFormView addSection:[INSStackFormSection sectionWithBuilder:^(INSStackFormSection *sectionBuilder) {

    [sectionBuilder addItemWithBuilder:^(INSStackFormItem *builder) {
        builder.itemClass = [CustomView class];
        builder.userInteractionEnabled = NO;
        builder.height = nil; // dynamic height
        builder.configurationBlock = ^(CustomView *view) {
            view.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
        };
    }];

    [sectionBuilder addItemWithBuilder:^(INSStackFormItem *builder) {
        builder.itemClass = [INSStackFormViewLabelElement class];
        builder.height = @50;
        builder.title = @"Title of text label";
        builder.configurationBlock = ^(INSStackFormViewLabelElement *view) {
            view.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
            view.textLabel.textColor = [UIColor redColor];
        };
        builder.actionBlock = ^(INSStackFormViewLabelElement *view) {
            NSLog(@"ACTION");
        };
    }];

    [sectionBuilder addItemWithBuilder:^(INSStackFormItem *builder) {
        builder.itemClass = [ActionView class];
        builder.height = @50;
        builder.configurationBlock = ^(ActionView *view) {
            view.accesoryType = INSStackFormViewBaseElementAccessoryNone;
            view.titleLabel.text = @"Click Me to remove section!";
        };

        builder.actionBlock = ^(INSStackFormViewBaseElement *view) {
            NSArray *errors = nil;
            if ([weakSelf.stackFormView validateDataItems:&errors]) {
                [weakSelf.stackFormView removeSection:[weakSelf.stackFormView.sections firstObject] animated:YES completion:nil];
            } else {
                UIAlertController *alert = [UIAlertController alertControllerWithTitle:@"Error" message:[errors firstObject] preferredStyle:UIAlertControllerStyleAlert];
                [alert addAction:[UIAlertAction actionWithTitle:@"OK" style:UIAlertActionStyleCancel handler:^(UIAlertAction * _Nonnull action) {
                    [weakSelf dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
                }]];
                [weakSelf presentViewController:alert animated:YES completion:nil];
            }

        };

        builder.validationBlock = ^BOOL(__kindof UIView *view, INSStackFormItem *item, NSString **errorMessage) {
            if (weakSelf.stackFormView.sections.count <= 1) {
                *errorMessage = @"Please don't delete me !!!";
                return NO;
            }
            return YES;
        };
    }];
}]];
```

## CocoaPods

Add the following to your `Podfile` and run `$ pod install`.

CocoaPods support iOS9

``` ruby
pod 'INSStackViewForms'
```

If you want to support <iOS9 where UIStackView is not available, solution is to use [OAStackView](https://github.com/oarrabi/OAStackView). I prepared subspec to make it easier.

CocoaPods support <iOS9

``` ruby
pod 'INSStackViewForms/OAStackView'
```

If you don't have CocoaPods installed, you can learn how to do so [here](http://cocoapods.org).

## ARC

`INSStackViewForms` uses ARC.
